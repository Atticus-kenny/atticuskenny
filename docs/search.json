The focus of the project is to obtain baseline data on hand hygiene compliance within the ICU. This baseline data will be used in a gap analysis to identify causes of non-compliance and develop interventions to promote a better environment of care. The project focuses on the implementation of multiple interventions in the forms of engineered controls, enhanced education of staff and policy changes-all of which are driven by the collection of both quantitative and quantitative data. I have a strong interest in infection control and disease prevention and have found this work to be both informative and rewarding.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
